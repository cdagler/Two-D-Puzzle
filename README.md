# Two-D Puzzle

### Overview
The ultimate goal of this program is to find all of the solutions to a Two-Definitional puzzle board if any exist.  The puzzle board is an N by M array of squares, and the puzzle pieces are a set of connecting square of one color. For example, here is a 4 by 3 board with a red and blue puzzle piece on it:
```
   0 1 2
 0 R R -
 1 R B B
 2 R - B
 3 - B B
```
I am in the process of solving this ultimate goal by first solving several sub-problems. 

### Sub-Problem 1: Create a 4 by 4 board and add 4 puzzle pieces to it of different shapes.
I have solved this problem, [hear](./subproblem1.md) is my solution.

### Sub-Problem 2: Create a method that rotates the puzzle pieces 90 degrees.
I have not started working on this problem yet.

### Sub-Problem 3: Have the program find one solution to the puzzle if it exists. 
I have not started working on this problem yet.
